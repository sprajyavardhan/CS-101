Objective-

Distance is calculated using Google Distance Matrix.
The distance calculated is the road distance between any two cities and not the least possible distance between any two cities.
With the aid google developers website, an API key was generated using my perosnal email ID.
This code calculates the distance between two points,namely origin and destination.
The distance is displayed in Km. 
The code does not show the distance if there isn't any road connection between two points. The code also does not show the distance between two points which do not exist on the google server or one of them.
There is only one py file attached by the name google123. Run the file and enter the name of the two places you want to calcuate the distance for.
The answer shows the distance as well as the state, country the two points belong to.

Details-

This code was constructed on python 2.7.13 and on MacOS Sierra. You will need to install googlemaps, simplejason and urllib2 libraries to run the code. You will also need to have an internet connection as it is linked to googlemaps.
