Distance calculation using Google Distance Matrix.
With the aid google developers website, an API key was generated using my perosnal email ID.
This code calculates the distance between two points,namely origin and destination.
The distance is displayed in Km. 
The code does not show the distance if there isn't any road connection between two points. The code also does not show the distance between two points which do not exist on the google server or one of them.
